\subsection{Model 6: Emissions-Profit Balance}
The provided assignment for analysis 2 is: \textit{"Based on the M5 model, create a multi-objective strategy balancing COâ‚‚ emissions and profits. Analyze three different weight configuration possibilities:}\\

\qquad - 0.5 and 0.5; and

\qquad - 0.25 and 0.75; and 

\qquad - 0.75 and 0.25."

To set up the multi-objective strategy, the weighted scoring method (WSM) is used. Given different objectives with their weights, a multiobjective problem is transformed into a single objective problem for the m objectives as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\sum_{i} w_i f_i(x)
\label{F m6 wsm example}
\end{equation}

The CO and Profit are based on the description of WSM theory, and the objective function from model 1 (formula \ref{M1 objective function}). They are defined as:

\begin{equation} 
Profit: \qquad Max \sum_{k\in V}    \sum_{i\in P}  \sum_{j\in P} X_{ijk} (Rev * w_i - PT * T_{ij}) 
\label{M6 Profit}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
CO: \qquad Min \sum_{k\in V}    \sum_{i\in P}  \sum_{j\in P} X_{ijk} (PCO * CO * w_i *d_{ij})
\label{M6 CO}
\end{equation}

Where the Profit function is a maximization, the CO is a minimization. Therefore the weight for Profit ($w_p$) is positive and the weight for CO ($w_{CO}$) is negative.
This results is the summed formula:

\begin{equation} 
Max \ \ w_p \ * \ (\sum_{k\in V}    \sum_{i\in P}  \sum_{j\in P} X_{ijk} (Rev * w_i - PT * T_{ij}) ) \ \ - \ \ w_{CO} \ * \ (\sum_{k\in V}    \sum_{i\in P}  \sum_{j\in P} X_{ijk} (PCO * CO * w_i *d_{ij}))
\label{M6 objective function}
\end{equation}
